Goal-setting
============

+ Get specific and use visuals of routes to get/stay inspired.
+ Design life for path of least-resistance for short-term goals.
  Going to the gym won't always be convenient or enjoyable. Build-up
  stuff I can do at home.
+ Develop specific plans to accomplish goals:
  - Long-range
  - Annual
  - Seasonal
+ Train specifically to improve weaknesses.

Positive Experiences

+ Micro hands and basically smearing feet
+ Thumb mantle with a hand foot match
+ Sharp, thin crack, positive enought to clip
+ Felt impossible at first
+ Collin Belay
+ Stick clipped first bolt?
+ *That Feeling* walking away from the send down the canyon into the sunset.

### Reaching For Razors (11d)
+ AF (Hell Cave)
+ Limestone
+ Mostly vertical (slight overhang at start)

Negative Experiences
====================

### Liquid Oxygen (12a)
+ AF (Division)
+ Limestone
+ Overhanging
+ Well-traveled
+ Really fun moves
+ Gaston mono!
+ Scary moves after mono (runout?)
+ Total mental shutdown to make the hard moves
+ Only tried it once
+ Not a lot of great warm-ups at Division (sketchy 10a, good 11a around the corner though)

### 11d in AF (Blackmagic wall?)
+ Good, but pumpy moves
+ Mental shutdown
+ Left draws forever
+ Kind of a pain to get to?
+ Weird crew I was with, Collin, Todd, bunch of others I wasn't used to being with.
+ No warmups that I can remember.

----------------------

Weaknesses
==========

+ Weak core
+ Get pumped on the steep *very* quickly
+ Thin holds on anything overhanging
+ Left hamstring pulls (or tweaks)
+ Poor pocket conditioning
+ Low Power (1 or 2 hard moves per problem)
+ Low Endurance (pumped after a few relatively easy sport climbs)

Strengths
=========

+ Very strong technical knowledge
+ Sequence and route finding are as good as anyone I know
+ Slab and vertical tend to be very good at
+ Good balance and body position/awareness
+ Know how to work a route (bypass easier moves to lock down hard moves)
+ Better than average at pinches and slopers
+ Love me a thin, technical, vertical/slab problem
+ Just love the feeling of movement
+ Love nature, hiking, camping
+ Love being out with people
+ Adventurous!
+ Strong desire to improve
+ Passion to help others learn to climb and improve
+ Happy to do the first lead of the day
